ðŸ“Œ Scenario

A mid-sized financial services company, Cousera, was facing growing risks from weak passwords, unmanaged privileged accounts, and suspicious sign-in attempts from risky locations.
As an Identity and Access Management Intern, I was tasked to design and implement security-first IAM practices using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Eliminate the use of weak or common passwords across all employees.

Ensure privileged accounts are just-in-time (JIT) and properly managed.

Protect user accounts from suspicious sign-ins and identity-based attacks using adaptive policies.

ðŸ”§ Implementation Steps
1. Microsoft Entra Password Protection

Configured a custom banned password list (e.g.,widget, Cousera, ).

Enforced password complexity rules across hybrid environment (on-premises AD + Entra ID).

Tested on a user "TestCouseraUser1@Cousera894.onmicrosoft.com" by attempting to reset passwords to banned values (blocked successfully).
    -Allowed all user to be able to reset their passwords

    -Revoked the user session to log the user out of all session

    -Tried to Reset the test user's password with the word  "Cousera, Widget"

âœ… Outcome: Users could no longer use predictable passwords; reduced risk of password spray attacks.

2. Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

Enabled PIM in Microsoft Entra ID to manage roles like Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator.

Configured Just-in-Time (JIT) access so admins could only elevate permissions when needed.

Added approval workflow (manager approval required before elevation).

Logged and reviewed audit reports for elevated role usage.

âœ… Outcome: Reduced standing privileges, minimizing insider and external threats.

3. Identity Protection Policies

Enabled User Risk Policy to require MFA or password reset if suspicious activity detected.

Configured Sign-in Risk Policy to block sign-ins from anonymous IPs, TOR browsers, or impossible travel scenarios.

Monitored risky users in Entra ID Identity Protection dashboard.

âœ… Outcome: Risky logins were automatically mitigated; compromised accounts could not continue operating undetected.
